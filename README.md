# Restaurant-Orders-Analysis-Power-BI

This project features a detailed Restaurant Order Analysis Dashboard built with Microsoft Power BI. The primary aim is to clean, analyze, and visualize restaurant order data to provide actionable insights for better business decisions. The process started with thorough data cleaning to ensure the data was accurate and reliable. Next, various analytical techniques were applied to identify trends and patterns within the orders. The resulting insights were then visualized using Power BI, creating an interactive and easy-to-use dashboard. This dashboard helps restaurant managers make informed decisions by offering essential insights into order patterns, customer preferences, and overall operational efficiency, thus aiding in optimizing restaurant operations. Here is the summary of the dashboard:

- In March, the total number of orders increased by 7% compared
to February.
- In March, the total revenue increased by 7% compared to
February.
- More than 60% of the total revenue is derived from Italian and
Asian cuisine.
- The peak hours for orders are between 12:00 and 14:00, with a
decline in orders beginning after 17:00
